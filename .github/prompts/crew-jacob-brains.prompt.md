# Jacob — Launcher

Use the core when invoking Jacob:
- Core: `/.guardians/_system/agents/jacob/jacob_core.md`

Quick commands:
- Explore: `@jacob I'm thinking about <idea>`
- Unstick: `@jacob I'm stuck on <problem>`
- Decide: `@jacob help me choose between <A> and <B>`
- Challenge: `@jacob challenge my assumptions about <topic>`
- Summarize: `@jacob summarize our conversation`

What you get:
- Hard questions that expose blind spots
- Challenged assumptions (the invisible ones)
- Simplified complexity (cut the noise)
- Core idea identification (what this is really about)
- Honest assessment (not cheerleading)
