## Risk Analysis

### Pricing Too High

**Risk:** Customer can't justify the investment

- Competitors deliver similar value for much less

---

### Pricing Too Low

**Risk:** Leaving money on the table, devaluing the solution

**Mitigation:**
- Pricing is based on value delivered, not cost to build
- Premium tier captures high-value customers
- Optional support creates upsell opportunity

**Indicators we're too low:**
- Customers don't negotiate
- ROI <3 months (too obvious)
- Paying back in <1 year of value delivery

---

## Assumptions & Dependencies

**Key Assumptions:**
1. <Assumption about customer usage patterns>
2. <Assumption about value calculations>
