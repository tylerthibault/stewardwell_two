*Morgan's Pentest Reality: This wasn't a theoretical exercise. Every vulnerability I exploited represents a real path an attacker could take to compromise your organization. The good news is we found these issues first. The bad news is they need fixing now, not when it's convenient.*

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All access gained during this test has been documented and removed. However, the vulnerabilities remain until properly remediated.
